## remote FS checklist
### pass
* read
* details
* destroy
* rename
* new directory/file
* hash/base64

### fail
* watch
* copy/paste
* double-click into new directory

## service
1 - shares should be read only by default with an option for all rights
2 - need to plan how to handle remote fs watches

## gui
1 - stop shares (only localhost shares) [blocked, adding and removing shares requires messaging to other users]
  - mouse drag select
2 - context menu
    c - edit file (opens file in textPad)
3 - copy by drag and drop from one modal to another
4 - add common keyboard support: ctrl+c, ctrl+v, del
5 - associate modals to an agent
    a - think through the data model
    b - display, such as "File Navigator - localhost"

## file list
2 - navigation security, do not allow parent navigation beyond a share

## copy/paste via messaging
1 copy writes to settings
2 transmits to messaging by agent
3 paste by agent

## populate systems logs
