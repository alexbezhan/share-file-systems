# Shared Spaces - Code of Conduct

## Bad Things
### Hostility
Hostility is unwelcome.  Any communication or contribution whose intention is illegality, hostility, or **directly** attacks any person; persons; or group will be removed and the user warned.  The second time this happens this project will find ways to prevent that hostile user from contributing in any and all forms.

### Offense
Being offended is not allowed.  If any contribution or communication is potentially problematic to any contributor or user let somebody know and authorized persons will make a careful consideration.  If an offended user provides any contribution or commentary of an offended or retaliatory nature that communication will be removed.  By disallowing all forms of offended/defensive communication this code of conduct hopes to remove any exercise of echo chambers.  Using personal politics and group thinking as a form of evidence to disparage a contrary idea is not acceptable and will be immediately removed as offended communication.  To be safe always defend your ideas with better evidence, experiments, or increased precision of practice.  If an idea is otherwise indefensible with evidence it is best to not defend it, or temporarily set it aside until such evidence becomes available.

## Good Things
### Challenging Communication or Positive Confrontations
People are allowed and encouraged to disagree.  Truth arises from the resultant collision or two or more competing ideas.  Encouraging people to speak their personal ideas encourages creativity and originality which is incredibly healthy to a project.  This is not an excuse to badge somebody by screaming louder/longer.  Once the communication moves beyond an exchange of novel ideas to a rhetorical exercise of winning the communication becomes a pursuit of hostility and hostile communication is not allowed.  Be civil.

### Be Honest, Be Original
Original ideas are exciting and offer unforeseen benefits even when they present views in opposition to a group's current line of thinking.  This is also healthy and strongly encouraged.
