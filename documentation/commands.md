## mkdir
Recursively creates a directory structure.  For example if 'my/new/path` were to be created but parent 'my' doesn't exist this command will create all three directories, but it will not alter or overwrite any artifacts already present. Relative paths are relative to the terminal's current working directory.

### Examples
1. `node js/application mkdir my/path/to/create`
   - This example would create directories as necessary to ensure the directory structure 'my/path/to/create' is available from the location relative to the terminal's current working directory.

1. `node js/application server 8080`
   - If a numeric argument is supplied the web server starts on the port specified and web sockets on the following port.
1. `node js/application server 0`
   - To receive a random available port specify port number 0.
1. `node js/application server browser`
   - The 'browser' argument launches the default location in the user's default web browser.
1. `node js/application server test`
   - The 'test' argument tells the server to use data from a separate storage location for running tests instead of the user's actual data.
1. `node js/application server test browser 9000`
   - An example with all supported arguments.  The three supported arguments may occur in any order, but the third argument (after 'browser' and 'test') must be a number.

## test
Builds the application and then runs all the test commands

### Examples
1. `node js/application test`
   - Runs all the tests in the test suite.
1. `node js/application test log`
   - The log argument turns on verbose logging output with annotations.

## test_browser
Launches the 'server' command as a child process, launches the default browser to execute DOM instructions as intervals of test automation, and then closes the browser upon completion.

### Examples
1. `node js/application test_browser`
   - Runs the browser interaction tests.
1. `node js/application test_browser no_close`
   - Disables the 'window.close()' command at the end of test instructions so that the browser remains open for manual inspection.
1. `node js/application test_browser demo`

1. `node js/application test_service`
   - Runs tests server utility.
1. `node js/application test_service fs:fs-copy`
   - Filter the tests to run by supplying a text fragment to filter against test names.  For example if there are 6 service tests whose names contain that string then only those 6 tests will be evaluated.
1. `node js/application test_service log`
   - The log argument turns on verbose logging output with annotations.
1. `node js/application test_service log log`
   - If you wish to enable verbose logging and filter tests by the word 'log' then simply include it twice.
1. `node js/application test_service log "Copy from Remote Device to different Remote Device"`

   - Using quotes the filter argument may contain spaces and other non-alpha characters.

## update
Pulls code from the git repository and then rebuilds the application.

### Examples
1. `node js/application update`
   - Without specifying a branch name the application assumes a branch name of 'master'.
1. `node js/application update devices`
