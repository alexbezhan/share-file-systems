# Priorities of Effort

1. Security - Do not expose any data outside the group and do not expose any data from group members what was not expressly shared.
2. Performance - The application should execute as fast as possible.
3. Simplicity - The user experience should be minimized into the fewest user actions possible.
4. Accessibility - Strive to achieve WCAG 2.0 AA compliance in all regards.
5. Presentation - The application should always communicate its utility as directly and consistently as possible regardless of operating system, web browser, or terminal interface.
